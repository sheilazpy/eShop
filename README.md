Simple university Java course project "eShop" with MySQL database support.

It works as an offline shop management local tool, with basic functionality
for products, orders and operators (users) management and references. 
The interface is in Bulgarian (cyrillic) language.

You can use, redistribute and modify as you wish on your own risk.

The above does not apply to my university colleagues except the contributors
of the project!
