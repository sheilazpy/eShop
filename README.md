Simple university Java course project "eShop" with MySQL database support.

It works as an offline shop management local tool, with basic functionality
for products, orders and operators (users) management and references. 
The interface is in Bulgarian (cyrillic) language.

If you are NOT my university colleague you CAN:
view, use, modify or redistribute this project as you wish on your own risk.

The rule above does not applies to my university colleagues which ARE
contributing to the project!
